# **Introduction**
 Automatic Plant Watering System Using Arduino in this the soil moisture sensor is the most amazing sensor used to measure the quantity of water present in the soil and defines the moisture level of the soil as the output. Because of its amazing operating principle this sensor used in application such as automatic irrigation system, agriculture research applications, landscape irrigation, indoor planting system, and lawns.
 
 #### **Research**
  Automatic Plant Watering System is a project which performs water pouring processes in the same way as the manual water providing to the plants. We can reduce manual tasks by   using this system. 

# **Cost & Features & Timeline**
#### Feature
- Fully automated system.
- Dry/wet moisture sesnsing.
 
# **Defining Our System**
 In this system, soil moisture sensor senses the moisture level of the soil. If soil will get dry then sensor senses low moisture level and automatically switches on the water pump to supply water to the plant. As plant get sufficient water and soil gets wet then sensor senses enough moisture in soil. After which the water pump will automatically get stopped. 


# **SWOT Analysis**
### Strengths
##### • To reduce workload.
#####  • Ease to use.
##### • Saves water.
##### • Easy to implement.
    
### Weakness
##### • If power cuts.
    
### Opportunities
##### • In agriculture.
##### • Home Gardening.
    
### Threats
#####  • System Crash Errors and ommision.

####  **4W's 1H**
#### Who 
Anyone can use this system for watering plant.
#### What
System is designed to provide water to plants automaticaly rather than following the tradional way.
#### When
If away from house to maintain the plants this project can be used.
#### Where
This project can used for automatic watering to plants for gardening, agriculture, etc.
#### How
In this system, soil moisture sensor senses the moisture level of the soil. If soil will get dry then sensor senses low moisture level and automatically switches on the water pump to supply water to the plant. As plant get sufficient water and soil get wet then sensor senses enough moisture in soil.
